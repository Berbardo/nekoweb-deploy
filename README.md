# Nekoweb Deploy Action
Deploy to nekoweb using a Github action.

# Usage

- Create a `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file in your repository.
- Add the following code to the `deploy.yml` file.
- Parameters:
  - `API_KEY`: Your Nekoweb API key. It must be stored in the Github repository secrets. Example: `${{ secrets.API_KEY }}`.
  - `BUILD_DIR`: The directory where the build files are located. **Modify the "Prepare build" step to copy the build files to this directory.** Example: `./build`
  - `DEPLOY_DIR`: The directory where the build files will be deployed. Example: if your build files are located in `./build` and you want to deploy them to the root directory, use `/`. If you want to deploy them to a subdirectory, use the subdirectory path. Example: `/subdir`
  - `CLEANUP`: If `True`, the deploy directory will be cleaned up before deploying the build files. **âš  Use with caution, especially on the root directory. All files in the remote directory (your website) will be deleted.** Example: `True` or `False`.
